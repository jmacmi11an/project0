# Rick Tac Toe
This is a Rick and Morty themed version of tic tac toe. All the normal rules apply.

## Instructions
- Load the game and enjoy the incredible title animation.
- Choose one of five characters from the Rick and Morty multiverse.
- Start the game with the "Get Schwifty" button.
- Take turns selecting boxes on the board.
- Keep selecting until somebody wins or it's a draw.
- That's it!



## Build Experience
When building this website I started with JS and hardcoded it for two players "rick" and "morty."
After refactoring it to be general I started building player objects for multiple characters with unique move and win sounds, images, and text.
Then I built an active scoreboard.

The player-object JS page just contains each possible character. The template is easy to update with more characters if desired.




Still to be done are:
- [ ] Improving the design, especially of the scorecard.
- [ ] Improving the design for mobile or smaller browser sizes
- [ ] Possibly deleting the rules paragraph
- [ ] Improving general design -  use different fonts for non titles to make more room
- [ ] Make the board smaller.
- [ ] Board sizing generally.
- [ ] Maybe try a modal pop-up for wins?
